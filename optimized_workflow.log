2025-04-30 10:20:13,283 - __main__ - INFO -   Schedule: It's best to schedule tweets at times when your audience is most active. Generally, mid-mornings and early afternoons work well. However, since you've selected 11:20 AM, it’s a good time as it's mid-morning.

Be sure to consider:
- Your audience's time zone
- Industry-specific peak times
- Engaging hashtags

To optimize, monitor engagement patterns and adjust future scheduling accordingly.

2025-04-30 10:20:13,793 - __main__ - INFO -   Schedule: To optimize engagement with your tweet, consider the following suggestions:

   - Ensure the content of the tweet is engaging, whether through interesting text, a call to action, or appealing media (image/GIF).

5. **Hashtags and Mentions:**
   - Use relevant hashtags and mention any influential accounts if applicable, to extend reach.

Once you've considered these elements, you can adjust the scheduled time if needed and proceed to schedule using a social media management tool like Buffer, Hootsuite, or directly on the Twitter platform.

3. **Audience Engagement:**
   - **Demographics:** Understanding the target audience's preferences will guide content creation.
   - **Followers' Activity Patterns:** Aligning with when followers are most active can enhance visibility and interaction.
  
4. **Current Trends:**

6. **Engagement Strategies:**
